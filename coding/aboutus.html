<h4>We all know that there are 118 elements present in our periodic table.  Our of these 118 elements 94 element are natural elements and 24 elements are synthetic elements.
 Back in the year 1800, only 30 elements were known. With the discovery of more and more element, remembering the elements and their properties were burdensome for scientists. 
They started gathering information about the elements and categorizing it.  The categorization of elements in tabular form according to their properties became popular. 
The   tabular form structure in which various elements are arranged according to their properties known as periodic table.
   	Dmitri ivanovich Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, was the most important contributor to the early development of the periodic table.
 In Mendeleev�s periodic table element were arranged on the basis of the fundamental properties, atomic mass and chemical properties.   
	During Mendeleev�s work only 63 elements were known. 
After studding the properties of every element, Mendeleev found that the of properties of element were related to atomic mass in periodic way. 
He arranged the element with similar properties fell into same vertical   columns of the periodic table.
